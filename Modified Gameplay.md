# The video game has been modified

![Logo](https://i.imgur.com/qOPBy7D.png)

Yes, with 1700+ Mods, the game has changed quite a lot. I will try to describe, in the most comprehensive manner, what exactly the list is and what goal it's trying to achieve.
I will start with what the list isn't.

## What the list isn't

This is not a list for thieves, pickpockets, or assassins. Such archetypes and skill trees have been nerfed. Why? I simply don't enjoy such builds and it is to discourage you from playing these types of builds. [RAID](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2345) is set to high on both interiors and exteriors; furthermore, no additional tools for assassins are added, unlike QWEST! which has Sneak Tools.
The quest mods, combat, magic and gameplay overhauls are chosen for warriors, paladins, mages, and wizards.

This is not a list for Legacy of the Dragonborn (LotD) and item hoarders. LotD is not in simply because I do not like how it forces you to become an item hoarder. I made QWEST! for the ultimate LotD experience, and now I'm making the complete opposite. 
LotD also displays the lowest quality armor and weapons mods in my opinion (Looking at you, Immersive Armors and Immersive Weapons). To compensate that lack, I've handplaced hundreds of items throughout the world such as spell tomes, weapons or gave unique NPCs unique gear like in From Software's games.
You're free from hoarding random items, and you have cool player homes with room for displaying what you want, not what LotD deemed worthy. [This is the kind of behavior I hope to avoid](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/747132474647248917/855547604561297428/unknown.png).
Even the [Dev Aveza](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24587), my favourite part of LotD, is in, without being held back.

## What the list is
## Gameplay - Combat | Engarde

The main combat overhaul of Aldrnari is **[Engarde](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25673) - "Fixing Skyrim's melee combat one tweak at a time"**.

It is one of the most diverse combat overhauls on Nexus and a really fun one when mastered. Here I will describe a few core mechanics, but since it has so many mechanics, I highly suggest reading and watching videos on it (or don't and figure out techniques and mechanics by yourself, at the price of a lot of deaths).

Unique Mechanics:
- Stamina Management: It is more similar to the Dark Souls Style; two or three slashes will deplete your full stamina and you wont be able to attack anymore, you will need to back off (and use the walk button) to regenerate a part of it. Power Attacks and blocking also depletes it. 
- Power Attacks: It is bound to a third button, detached from your usual click, and it has a cooldown. No more power attack spam with a warhammer to kill every bandit.
- Off-hand: By default, if you have a Sword and a spell on your off-hand, using your left hand key will block and not use the spell. This allows dual wield blocking (which is needed in Aldrnari). To use the spell in your off-hand, press shift (by default) and your left hand key at the same time.
- Enemies actually use stamina, so if they spam power attacks, play defensively and wait for the moment to strike!
- Weapons have different ranges depending on what type they are.
- Armors have resistances based on their keywords. If you use a dagger against steel armor, it obviously won't penetrate the steel. The same system applies to you, though, so play smart!
- [Dodging is extremely important](http://prntscr.com/1i3k35m), the default key is C (when following my MCM Setup) and will only work when weapons are drawn. The invincibility frames, also known as iFrames, are generous, and it'll get you out of trouble a lot.

### Gameplay - Combat | Other Combat Overhauls

The list doesn't only ship with Engarde! Other mods come to make an ever more Dark Souls-inspired combat experience;
- [ZUPA](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45182) forces 3rd person and plays an animation when drinking a potion, like how there's an animation for Estus in Dark Souls.
- [Smart Optimal Salves](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42402) is an add-on to ZUPA, so you don't have to go in your inventory to drink a potion!
- [zxlice BackStab and Parry](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43436) is self-explanatory! Backstabs and attacks of opportunity after succesful blocks... A really neat add-on.
- [Heartbreaker](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1847) allows you to rip people's hearts straight from their chest. Metal, isn't it?
- [SmoothCam](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41252) and [True Directional Movement](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51614) for the camera control, so it's actually usable in 3rd person.

### Gameplay - Combat | Enemies 

Enemies will be drastically changed; I have made a very thorough merge of many popular enemy overhauls, completely patched to work together. We are talking about mods like:
- [Skyrim Revamped - Complete Enemies Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14598) which buffs almost all enemies in the game.
- [Briraka's Draugr Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26188) and [Draugr Upgrades and Improvements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21775) which makes named draugr more unique and brings varieties like fire draugr to the game.
- [OBIS](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4145) the unavoidable bandits overhaul, with its Patrols addon.
- [Better Vampires NPCs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9510#) with [Ubervamps](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28919) which makes them an actual threat. I also added my own, unique, non available on nexus mod; **Sovn's Ebony Vampires - Porting Requiem Enemies to Vanilla Skyrim**.
- [Heritage](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30017) which brings more enemy variants to almost all classes.
- [High Level Enemies](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3231) which, instead of the usual more variants, adds level 60+ enemies into leveled lists. 
- [Real Bosses](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18183) because Skyrim Revamped does not touch bosses, for some reason, so this overhauls those to make sure the minions aren't stronger than the actual boss.
- [SkyTEST](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1104) for animals only so they are an actual threat passed level 5.
- [Dragon War](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51310) and its Variants add-on are what brings diversity and difficulty to Dragons so every encounter is a new challenge.
- My very own **Sovn's Enchanted Spheres - Porting Requiem Enemies to Vanilla Skyrim** to bring some actual bosses in Dwarven ruins.
- A set of 30+ Mihail Mods, which adds new enemies that dot the landscape. You can find them in the modlist under "MM -".
- [Skyrim Immersive Creatures](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12680) is now fixed, implementing a ton of new enemies which will obviously help a lot bringing diversity to the world!

Those are only the most prominent overhauls present. The above list isn't exhaustive.

"Wow Sovn, this is some madness! How am I supposed to survive?" Well listen here buddy, **the Encounter Zones are handmade**.

That's right, I heavily modified [Open World Loot](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49681)'s encounter zones. For the first couple levels early on, you will want to fight bandits. They should be as bad at combat as you. As you progress through doing [Missives](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17576) or normal quests due to [Experience](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17751), you will get more enemies with more perks, and you will be able to do more and more stuff.

More on that in the next chapter of this guide.

## Gameplay - Leveling

Bandits are the best enemy in the beginning; they barely know how to fight (except their leaders) and aren't that organized. As you progress, you should be able to tackle stronger enemies such as draugr, forsworn, mages, dwarven constructions, dragons, and finally vampires and dragon priests.

Vampires are deceptively strong, do not fight them early, you will get murdered. Why? Because the game is **semi-leveled**; lemme explain:
- Normal enemies still scale with you, they start at lower levels and have a lot of variants between level 1 and 90.
- Bosses are higher level by default, between level 15 and 250 (that includes quest mods). There are a lot of static bosses that are straight up god-like, such as Master Vampires and Dragon Priests.
- All enemies get perks depending on their level. A level 1 enemy has 1 perk and a level 60 enemy has 60 perks.

**"But how do you get to the higher levels yourself? How do you even train your combat skills if everyone kills you"** - I am glad you asked! Let me introduce you to the 2 core mods for Player leveling:

- **[Experience](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17751)**
- **[Static Skill Leveling - Experience Mod Add-on](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30410)**

You will level up by discovering places, killing any enemy, and doing quests. Your stats do not influence your leveling at all, that is [Experience](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17751) Here is what the add-on changes:**Whenever you sleep, you will be able to allocate skill points in the skills you wish to improve on!**. Only the first time you sleep, after you've leveled up and added your Stamina/Health/Magic bonus, that is why [Campfire](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/667) is in ([it also uses a bonfire, neat isn't it?](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41223)).

But that isn't all there is to help you on your quest to becoming a god among men. Let's talk about the main overhauls.


## Gameplay - Main Overhauls | Perks, Races, Standing Stones, Magic, Religion and Alchemy

So I mostly play with **EnaiRim**, especially the full overhauls, and that isn't going to change *too much*. Lemme show you:

- **[Ordinator](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1137)** for main perks.
- **[Growl](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31245)** for werewolf perks.
- **[Sacrosanct](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3928)** for vampire perks.

They have been choosen because they enable many different playstyles and also make you very powerful. Remember, we're not trying to nerf the player, just buff the enemies.

- **[Palladium Racials](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43890)**

One of the deviations from main EnaiRim. Why? Because it allows both NPCs and the Player to use its passive effects, and it has parts of Imperious along with parts of other race overhauls. It will also bring a good diversity of potential builds.

- **[Mundustar](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41674)**

Standing Stones overhaul with some drawbacks. I really wanted something different from the usual Andromeda, so I gave Mundustar a chance, and so far it has yet to disappoint me.

- **[Odin](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46000)** for vanilla spells.
- **[Arcanum](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23488)** and **[Triumvirate](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39170)** for added spells.
- **[Forgotten Magic Redone](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12711)** for reward spells. (more info below)
- **[Forceful Tongue](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36276)** for shouts.
- **[Reliquary of Myth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31612)** for artifact enchantments.
- **[Challenging Spell Learning](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20521)** for spell learning.

I really wanted a certain spell that loots bodies around you from Odin, so it's how this one got chosen over Mysticism. Many have suggested Arcanum in my old list, so I'm giving it a chance here. Trust me, there's more than enough spells for any type of mage with this setup, so no need for Apocalypse or similar large package mods! Forgotten Magic Redone's tomes have been **handplaced throughout the world, quest mods included, so they're rewarded at completion of quests and key moments in the game**. Let's be honest, that mod's spells are absolutely OP, and they're supposed to be lost, so why would a merchant sell them in the Bannered Mare? A notes with hints on where to get them lies on a bench where knowledge is gathered within Skyrim. Triumvirate just makes sense, due to some spells fitting the atmosphere.

Forceful Tongue is used to overhaul Shouts as I've never really gotten into Thunderchild, so I wanted something I'd actually use. In the total opposite mindset, Reliquary of Myth is used because it simply is so much more fun than Zim's in my opinion.

As for Challenging Spell Learning, that's because eating books sucks and is too simple. This mod will trigger a sort of "ritual" where your magicka will be drained for 10 seconds and if it doesn't reach zero, you learn the spell. The strength of the drain depend on the level of the spell, it's mana cost, and your enchantments. Failing the ritual gives you a temporary debuff.

- **[Pilgrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54099)**

Simon's latest overhaul, I really wanted to test it since Wintersun was always just "here" in my eyes.

- **[Apothecary](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52130)**

I have sworn to never use kryptopyr's CACO ever again. This overhaul does *exactly* what it needs to do and is actually not a pain to patch. This is why it has been chosen. 
We use both the Main mod and it's Food addon!



You have all the tools to conquer the world thanks to the absurd strength and overpowered items, but those tools are also available to your enemies which will be forever challenging.

Now that the bulk of the gameplay has been covered, I will continue on the atmosphere of the list.

## Gameplay - Less known available tools.

The main overhauls are what define most of your strenght; but a lot has been added on the side so you can clutch boss fights with a well prepared arsenal.

#### [ScrollScribe SE - A Scroll Crafting Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32439)

You will very quickly notice how almost every bandit has access to magic.. sound annoying right? Especially since magic is quite overpowered in this list.
Fear not, you have also access to very strong spells, that only get stronger, despite your lack of mana!

Welcome to Scrollscribe, simply go to an inn and use the power in your magic tab to see how you can craft scrolls! Just requires paper and soul gem dust!

Check out the [modpage](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32439) if you wanna dive deeper into it.

#### [Alchemist Arsenal - Arrows Bolts Bombs and Traps](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42030)

Always wanted to be a mad scientist in Skyrim? Welcome to Alchemist Arsenal! The first step of your journey is to visit a Alchemy vendor and purchase "The Alchemist Arsenal Guide" in one of the major cities. This is a Book / Journal that will allow you to build the kit at a forge.
Afterward, with your newfound knowledage, you can make some really cool weapons

Check out the [modpage](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42030) if you wanna dive deeper into it.

#### [Mystic Condenser](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10176)

Good job, you've killed a bandit camp, you now have 50 minor potion of healing, but you really dont want to use them as you have that animation when taking potions.. Is it still worth taking them? Yup it is! Thanks to Mystic Condenser, you can merge those little potions into bigger ones!

Check out the [modpage](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10176) if you wanna dive deeper into it.

#### [Vitrium](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57242)

It's a tools pack, with cool animation, every buff is really significant: from bonus damage, imbuing your weapon with an element like a resin in Dark Souls or a temporary ward!

Check out the [modpage](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57242) if you wanna dive deeper into it.

#### [Conduit](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/58023)

When holding a weapon in one hand and a spell in the other, you are able to temporarily "conduct" the spell through that weapon. Different categories of spells make the weapon do different things!

Check out the [modpage](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/58023) if you wanna dive deeper into it.

#### [The Wizard Warrior](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14890)

Last but no least, The Wizard Warrior allows for spellcasting via weapons. It is the absolute dreams for any spellsword character.

Only downside: gatekept behind 70 Destruction, so it's not available right off the bat. But it's a build defining mod for sure!

Check out the [modpage](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14890) if you wanna dive deeper into it. But keep in mind the mod's obtention of the spells and shouts are behind the perk, a specificity of the list!

## Visuals - Atmosphere and Weathers
### Welcome to NAT.ENB III

NAT.ENB is l00ping's last work, it is an extremely varied weather. It is made to be as customizable as possible for ENBs and comes with a decent one (reminder, it's a Weather+ENB Combo). By default NAT III isn't the greatest looking but still holds up against modern ENBs. 

It shines most when replacing it with l00Ping's photography suite ***[PRT XII - PhotoRealistic Tamriel 12](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4743)*** and it becomes, in my opinion, the best ENB currently released.
It does everything, and it's preset selection shows it. All the available presets are in the "ENBs" folder in the installation folder, pick one, see if you like, uninstall, if you don't like, repeat. *It's really that simple.*

My favourite preset? GrittyReality.

If you're into tailoring your graphics, this ENB is made for you, go read it's modpage, you'll be able to reach summits you never could never imagine. 

### Visuals - City Overhauls

- Base is [JK's Lite](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/71018) for most cities. On top of that, we use [Civil War Checkpoints](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17364) so the world looks really at war.
- Riverwood has [Galaxy's Riverwood](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46360) and [Riverwood Flowering](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39229), it gives it a unique and cheerful look.
- [Cities of the North: Dawnstar](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28952), [Cities of the North: Falkreath](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56731) , [Cities of the North: Morthal](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34168) and [Cities of the North: Winterhold](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40088) give those cities a really unique and Nordic atmosphere.
- Whiterun is now real fortified place thanks to [Fortified Whiterun](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40094). It also has a lot of hand-placed trees so its connection to Kyne is felt throughout the city.
- Solitude now feels like a capital city with [The Great City of Solitude](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22243), [Drengin's Blue Palace Terrace](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35180) and [Solitude Skyway](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8250) fully patched together!
- Windhelm also feels like a capital, with [Capital Windhelm Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42990) and [City Entrances Overhaul: Windhelm](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19400)
- Riften is now a real influencial fishing port thanks to [Riften Docks Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40021) and gains some verticality thanks to [Another Skyrim: Riften](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/86586).
- Markarth's wall is now massive thanks to [City Entrances Overhaul: Markarth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37375)
- "The Great City" Series overhauls a good number of minor towns and cities; we're talking [Rorikstead](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20151), [Mixwater Mill](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36350), [Karthwasten](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33032), [Kynesgrove](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42639), [Old Hroldan](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33189), [Ivarstead](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34505) and [Shor's Stone](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35977).
- Dragon Bridge is overhauled by [Rodryk](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42510)
- [Settlements Expanded](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7777) make sure even miners around small mines have houses.
- Raven Rock isn't forgotten, we use [Quaint Raven Rock](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20851)
- The College of Winterhold is now a hub of magic thanks to [Obscure's College of Winterhold](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20514).
- [Sepolcri](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34105) makes sure the cemeteries in Solitude, Riften, and Falkreath aren't lame.
- [Viking Towns of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17132) and [Lyngwi](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13526) are two mods adding Nordic-looking cities on top of everything that is above! 
- Interiors are massively overhauled thanks to [jkrojmal](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/1305814?tab=user+files)'s Interior series, in combination with [Distinct Interiors](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6130) and [EEK's Whiterun Interiors](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10463); all working together thanks to [Czasior's Patches](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/9933289?tab=user+files)

### Visuals - Armors and Weapons

I love high quality armors and weapons. We are talking assets from Team TAL, Christine, FunkyGandalfCat, JS, DX, and other renowned artist. This is why I am going on a journey to hand-place as many items as possible throughout the world in a lore friendly way.

As an example, I have distributed into Leveled Lists, thanks to [Open World Loot](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49681), weapons from [Skyrim Weapons Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32500) or [Team TAL's Mordhau Weapons Pack](https://www.patreon.com/posts/mordhau-weapon-1-28144583) or armors from [Team TAL's Mordhau Armors Pack](https://www.patreon.com/posts/alpha-mordhau-by-27867837). While some NPCs have unique armors, in a Dark Souls way.

Hand-placed items are not restricted to armors and weapons, you will find spell tomes and other cosmetic items at the end of dungeons. Lastly some armors' recipes have been gated behind quests! For example, if you want Serana's Vampire armor, you must complete some Dawnguard Quests before being able to create it for yourself.

You can also notice that not lorefriendly armors have been added to the list, like [Spindrift Knight](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53728) or [Grandmaster Wolven](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51572), those are still in the game! You will have access to them by taking 2 perks in the smithing tree: 
- Hallowed Seamstress and Stoneweaver
  - For jewelry and dresses (Lore-Friendly)
- Senua's Wisdom
  - For items that are not Lore Friendly and/or Skimpy

This is made so you are not cluttered with 2000 free gear at level 1.

## Gameplay - Quests
### Gameplay - Main Questline, Daedric Quests, Miscellaneous Quests and DLCs

- [Alternate Perspective](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50307) is the alternate start choice of Aldrnari. Basically, Helgen is still there and you can interract with it. When you're ready, walk up to the barkeeper and rent a room; sleeping in it will make the intro start but from an.. alternate perspective.

### Gameplay - Modified and Expanded Quests

- The Companions are heavily modified by [Don't be a milk drinker](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19490), [questline tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22300) and [More Radiant quests](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24144)

- [You can avoid the entirety of the Forsworn conspiracy.](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43850)

### Gameplay - New Quests
Gotta have quest mods if there is no Legacy of the Dragonborn, right? 

- **[VIGILANT](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11849)** brings a Vigilant of Stendarr questline, featuring the never ending struggle against Molag Bal. Vicn's first quest mod. Heavily inspired by Dark Souls in its atmosphere, styles, combats, enemies, armors, and stories. Has the most tweaks of all the quest mods for the ultimate experience. Separated in 4 Acts. It is also my favourite quest mod.
- **[UNSLAAD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11789)** is a Half Dragon quest mod. The second work of Vicn. Very similar to VIGILANT but with a way colder and sad atmosphere rather than dark and grim. Can also be quite wholesome per moments. Heavily inspired by Dark Souls. It is also my second favourite quest mod.

### Inigo...?
A majority of people like him. I personally don't. On top of that, users reported non-issues from other Wabbajack lists to his Nexus page which led them to make a public pinned post about their [non-favorable stance with what we do](http://prntscr.com/1b2tt18). He needs tweaks, he is too strong and unbalanced, all followers above have been tweaked, since I am not allowed to do so by the Mod Author, I will not include him. This decision is final.
