# Aldrnari Known Issues:

### With Fix:
- Random Crashes refering skeletons: Can't fix. It's animation related, the game renders an NPC in a weird position and crashes. [Example](https://pastebin.com/1rjAwJnp) - Fix: Avoid the location for a few hours and come back later.
- "Prophet" Quest not starting correctly / Isran not going to Serana / Serana not here. Fix: [Pinned in Support Discord](http://prntscr.com/1stoif9)

### Without Fix:
- Fellglow Keep missing Walls
- Ravenscore Spire Landscape
- Silver Longsword Scabbard not having a texture
- NPC Vampire Lords and Werewolves are invisible
- Character Invisibility: Caused by HDT Armors

### More Random Issues:
- Slow loading times: Can't fix Skyrim Engine; It's a big list, get a faster drive.
- Crashes when reloading a savefile: Known and unavoidable, if you're getting ganked and die a lot, go back there later.
- Character Invincibility, unable to cast spells/powers: Cause Unknown - Potential Fix: selecting the player character in console and doing ``setghost 0``
- DarkenD Crashes: Seems to be caused by BDS2.0 from the crashlog but I couldn't reproduce it.

## Not Issues:
- Skills not leveling up
- Dying often
- Animals not attacking
- Very strong enemies everywhere
- Some armors being invisible/vanilla looking depending on race
- Gear unequipping when using favorited stuff
