## Beta - 0.2.0 | Official Release Update - Part 1 of the Weapons and Armors Update

**Released at**: `24/08/2021`

**Notes** : 
- Not Savefile Compatible
- Due to the nature of the list, updates going forward are extremely likely to not be savefile compatible. This is due to the multiple merges, and the HalgariRPGLoot Patcher that allows a variety of enchanted weapons and armors within Leveled Lists.
- This is the first part of the weapons and armors update, more handplaced gear will come in the following updates. Items not only from Nexus but also other sites like Loverslab, Patreon or Sunkeumjeong will come. I have a big library of stuff I want to implement, and we're at the 30%.
- this is still a beta, a playable and clean beta as judged by the testers, but still a beta.
